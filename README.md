# Inventory-Management-and-Sales-Prediction-Analysis
This project analyzes sales data, stock levels, and temperatures to predict future sales and optimize inventory. It includes data preprocessing, EDA, model selection (Linear Regression, Random Forest), hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. Insights into factors impacting sales decisions are provided.
## Project Overview
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, merging, and preparing datasets for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and patterns.
- **Model Selection and Training:** Implementing and evaluating Linear Regression and Random Forest models.

**Model Evaluation:** Assessing model accuracy using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
