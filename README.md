# Inventory-Management-and-Sales-Prediction-Analysis
This project utilizes historical sales data, sensor-based stock levels, and storage temperatures to predict future sales and optimize inventory management strategies for Gala Groceries. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection using both Linear Regression and Random Forest, and model evaluation. The aim is to provide actionable insights into how stock levels and temperature variations impact sales, enabling informed decision-making for inventory and operational efficiencies.
## Project Overview
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, merging, and preparing datasets for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and patterns.
- **Model Selection and Training:** Implementing and evaluating Linear Regression and Random Forest models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model accuracy using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
